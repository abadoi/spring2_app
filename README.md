# spring2_app
Spring reactive webclient using Java11, Spring Webflux and Spring Boot 2+


#### This app was first designed to run with the new lightweight functional programming model ( that uses Routes and Handlers as an alternative to the annotation-based programming model) but otherwise runs on the same Reactive Core foundation.
but
#### decided to fallback to the traditional Spring MVC controllers with the reactive WebClient which uses the same annotations from Spring Web MVC module.
